First, when on raspberry pi 4, create and activate a python virtual environment (venv) 
so that you can pip install the following.

pip install mediapipe # (facial landmark detection)
pip install pyautogui # (to control mouse cursor)
pip install pyttsx3   # (tts functionality)
pip install pygame    # (for the ball game)

Make sure the environment with these packages is active when you run both Keyboard_main.py
in the VKeyboard-TTS folder and example.py in the GazeTracking folder.
