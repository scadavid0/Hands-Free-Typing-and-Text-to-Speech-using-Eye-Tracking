There are two main files to run:

-Keyboard_main.py (in VKeyboard-TTS folder) OR Game_class.py

-example.py (in GazeTracking folder)

First, run Keyboard_main.py. Make sure you've activated the environment with the necessary
packages (see INSTALL.txt). This will display the interactive virtual keyboard that you
will use to do gaze typing. 
OR, run Game_class.py if you want to play the ball game instead.

Next, run example.py (again, make sure the environment is active). This will start the
calibration process. Once that finishes, your gaze will be controlling the cursor. Use
your actual mouse or trackpad to click.
