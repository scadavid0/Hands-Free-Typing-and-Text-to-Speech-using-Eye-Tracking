zip file contents:

"data" contains time data for several functions and methods in the gaze tracking code, to
see what actually bottlenecks performance. getavgs.py reads the data and gets the averages,
which we discuss in the Team-4-report.pdf.

"design" contains the list of parts needed to assemble our project. There is no need to
construct or manufacture anything, e.g., PCBs. All items can be ordered on the internet
and assembled out of the box, with a total cost of <$100 for our final setup.

"src" contains the source code for the project with documentation on how it works and how
to use it.

"videos" contains the two video demos we should for our in-class presentation.

COPYRIGHT.txt attests copyright for our project.

Team-4-poster.pdf is our project poster that we would've presented in-person had we opted
for the demo day.

Team-4-slides.pdf is our presentation slides that we gave in class.
